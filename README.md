### Project Title
Exploring US Bikeshare Data

### Description
With the program it is possible to pull out requested US bikeshare data in 3 major cities (New York, Washington, Chicago). In an interactive way users are prompted to choose a City, Month or Day they are interested in. 

The Output are some statistical data like: 

- The most frequent time of travel
- Most popular stations
- Most popular day of the week
- Most common start hour
- Calculating trip duration
- Some user stats

### Files used

Python program:

- bikeshare_2.py 

Data:
- washington.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- chicago.csv

### Some data information

- Because of the size, data files are not hosted on Github (If you are interested to run the program with the original data, just let me know and I can send you the data in another way)
- Data are available for the months January to June
- Washington does not have data for gender and birthdates
